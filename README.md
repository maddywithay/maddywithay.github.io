my GitHub account doesn't have much to show right now. It's using the free version, has my username, and so far just contains this one file created for class
this repository I created is an original file, named per instructions. This is its only history so far, it is private, and is neither shared nor in collaboration with anybody else. 
to clone this repository to my laptop, I downloaded the desktop version of GitHub, logged in, selected this repository to clone, and saved it as a folder to my desktop.
